# Project AuthKit

A showcase project demonstrating a secure RESTful authentication API using modern Java practices.

This project is part of a personal "sprint" to build a production-ready, containerized, and CI/CD-enabled authentication service. It serves as a tangible proof of my ability to quickly learn, solve problems, and implement high-quality engineering practices.

## ‚ú® Features (MVP)

- **User Registration**: `POST /api/auth/register` with email and password. Passwords are securely hashed using BCrypt.
- **User Login**: `POST /api/auth/login` to authenticate users.
- **(Upcoming)** Magic Number Authentication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot 3
- **Core Dependencies**: Spring Web, Spring Security, Lombok
- **Database**: H2 (for local development), PostgreSQL (for production)
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+
